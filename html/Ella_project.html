    <h1>For my programming project Charlotte and I will be creating a Mod for minecraft! 11/19/20: I have downloaded all the of sites and programs needed to complete this project and will be starting the code next. 12/20/20: I have been having some issues with a certain file named forge practice sincer it says the version is out of date. I have spent the past week trying to download other alternatives in order to continue with the project however none have worked. I will continue to work over break and find a solution to this. 
    <p>
    Charlotte: Ella and I ran into a seemingly never-ending list of errors while doing our project. Our concept was to create a Mod for Minecraft and we looked through various tutorials to do so. First we downloaded the Java Developer Kit (version 8), which lets us mod on Minecraft in Eclipse. Next, we had to download software to set up our text editor. We downloaded the Eclipse IDE. We had to first launch the Eclipse installer to then install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, since Java is the language used in Minecraft. My computer crashed while running the Eclipse installer and attempting to download Eclipse IDE, for whatever reason, but I just tried downloading it again and it worked. Then we downloaded the 1.12.2 version of Minecraft Forge, which lets us mod Minecraft 1.12.2, and versions beyond it. The version of Forge we used was Mod Development Kit (MDK) for 1.12.2. We unzipped the folder and created a new copy of it, which would become our project folder. The next software we installed was Pinta, which is a program that lets us change the look of the Sword texture in Minecraft. My version of Pinta, despite following a tutorial we found online, ended up being completely in Spanish. After troubleshooting this for a while and trying to re-download it, I gave up and just navigated the app in Spanish. Next we launched Eclipse and imported our project folder. We ran into more issues on this step since some of the software was outdated and no longer supported on my computer. After importing my project folder, there were many errors that appeared on my Eclipse workspace that Mr. Lindow tried to help me work through by researching them. There were also files missing from my project folder, so I went back several steps and redownloaded the Minecraft Forge, but this proved unsuccessful, and there were still missing files. I ran into more issues at the beginning of this process than Ella did, so we worked primarily from her computer over FaceTime.

      Ella:Once we switched to my computer I was in the process of importing the forge practice folder into the eclipse workspace that would allow us to continue our process. However, once I imported the file I received an error message that said: “could not run build action using Gradle distribution.” I was extremely confused as to what this meant and first had to understand the problem itself. After some research, I found that this was due to an error connecting to the Gradle build system. I was unable to find any clear answer on how to solve this issue so I used some trial and error to find a solution. After a lot of unsuccessful research, I decided to try and find another tutorial. I looked through other websites and read through a booklet while trying to follow the steps, but none of the tutorials were detailed enough or able to help me create a mod. Eventually, I figured I would be better off continuing the old tutorial and finding other ways to troubleshoot the issue. While this was a very lengthy process, I tried downloading other Gradle files and updating the build ship application in eclipse. This was unsuccessful. Eventually, I tried downloading a different version of forge practice and it did not give me an error message but many of the files needed to continue the process were missing and I could not figure out why they would not appear. A few days later when I went back to work on the project the error message reappeared and I did not understand what had changed. At this point, I was so close to being able to write the code for our mod but was unable to reach that point. I spent many more hours trying to find a solution but nothing proved successful. At this point, Charlotte and I discussed that, while frustrating, it would be a better use of our time to switch to another project where we could make more progress.
While this project was unsuccessful I still learned a lot about the process of making mods for minecraft.

   1/14/21: I have put together the entire robot and will now work on the coding portion
   <p>
    <p>
      1/24/21 semester update:
    Putting together the robot was a lot of fun. It allowed me to understand the egineering aspect of programming which I found very intresting. To assemble the robot screw driver and individually attached each of the small pieces together. Once this was done I added the arduino board, which will be how I can program the robot. I also attached sensors to the front of the robot which I can now create code using the sensors. Once the robot was assembeled I downloaded an app on my phone that I can use to drive the car. Next I downloaded Arduino on my computer and the instruction mannual for creating my code and ideas of different projects to make with my robot. I have started the tutorial but I still have a lot to complete.

        I am continuing to work on writing code for my robot but have run into an issue that has to do with my computers ability to connect to the board of the robot. I am working to troubleshoot this issue with a few different online resources.

        I am continuing to work on writing code for my robot and am still working to troubleshoot the connection issue with a few different online resources. I have also been discussing with charlotte a time we are both free to set up a meeting to fix this issue.

        I Havent been able to work on my robot this week because my computer was being fixed at the apple store but I should get it back this weekend and will work extra on it to make up the lost time

       The motor of the robot has stopped working and I am still unable to connect the arduino board to the computer, however I am working on the code so once the issue is fixed it should work. I am gonna order a different connecter which will hopefully fix the issue.
